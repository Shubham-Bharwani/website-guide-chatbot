Conversatum Get the App Conversation Copilot More Than Just Meeting Notes Much of your knowledge flows through your conversations with other people, so transcription shouldn’t just end with a wall of text and some meeting notes. What if you could use AI and analytics to organize, visualize, and study it? Get the App Contact Us Numbers Let’s Talk Trends We started with an idea: that the most productive learning happens through human connection and intriguing conversation. It turns out that others feel the same. 27 On average, people have 27 conversations per day. 4.5 Totaling 4.5 hours 86% 86% of employees say they learn best by collaborating with others. 70% On average, we forget 70% of new knowledge in 24hrs When there’s so much knowledge flying around us, why wouldn’t we want to harness it? As technologists, we like to think of it as open-source learning! Our Process Document Analyze Recall Implement Document This is where it all begins. Transcribe audio, tell who said what, format  text, add notes, and get paraphrasing for selected passages for you to document  discussions and add additional thoughts and context. Trust Why Our Team is Different Honesty in Pricing Using the latest in AI shouldn’t mean that your pocket gets lighter, and education is at an all-time premium, so Conversatum is working on affordable pricing plans so that the conversation doesn’t have to turn to your bank account! Versatility We’re working to build functions which will suit you in every exchange, whether its a Q&A, debate, mentorship session, or just a brainstorm. Privacy & Security There’s an ever-argued debate about data security versus data usability. So, we want to give you the ability to choose how your data is stored, how its processed, and what features you use. Team We’re a start-up. While that means we’re small, our development and design team is highly qualified and has over 60 years of combined experience in technology and mobile design and boasts backgrounds at IBM and Textron as well as the flexible freelance market. Community We want to double down on our community and create an environment for sharing ideas, discussing interesting topics, and connecting with other users as well as our team! We’re starting with a discord server, but there’s much more to come! Empowerment We’re human, and we believe very simply in creating technology that helps people see themselves grow. We want to give you insights that help you learn more about yourself, the people you interact with, how people speak, and the subjects you talk about, so that you can always know where you stand and can bring your ideas to reality without losing anything through the translation of pen to paper. What We’re Building Cutting Edge Transcription We’re refining our transcription methods in an attempt to provide OpenAI quality transcription in real-time both online and offline. Analytics We’re developing powerful analytics to provide you with the insights you need to gain new perspective on yourself, your relationships, & the subjects you talk about. AI Features Don’t you wish you could get more than just AI meeting notes? Well, we’re excited to be building features that make talking to computers as powerful as it should be. Right now, we’re making transcription and diarization available at a flat monthly rate, no minutes, no credits, no guesswork. We’ve got a whole lot more in store and we hope you’ll support us as we build and release industry changing features over the next several months.
